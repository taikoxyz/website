# Deploy a contract

This guide will help you deploy a smart contract to Taiko.

## Prerequisites

- You have testnet ETH on Taiko (to pay the transaction fee for deploying the contract).
  - You can [request Sepolia ETH](/docs/guides/receive-tokens#receive-sepolia-eth) from the faucet and then [use the bridge](/docs/guides/bridge-tokens) to send testnet ETH to Taiko.
- You have the private key to the account with testnet ETH on Taiko.

### Additional Remix prerequisites

- You have [setup your wallet](/docs/guides/setup-your-wallet) to connect to the relevant testnets.

      **1. Visit the Remix website**
      Visit [remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org).

      **2. Select a smart contract**
      ![select a smart contract](/images/guides/deploy-remix/select.png)

      **3. Compile your smart contract**

      **1. Install Foundry**

      See the [Foundry installation guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

      **2. Create a project with Foundry**

      ```sh
      forge init hello_foundry && cd hello_foundry
      ```

      **3. Deploy your contract**

      Deploy the contract located at `src/Counter.sol`. Replace `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` below with your private key which has some testnet ETH on Taiko.

      Use a throwaway wallet to be safe. Don't reveal the private key of a wallet
      with significant value!
      </Callout>

      ```sh
      forge create --rpc-url https://rpc.jolnir.taiko.xyz --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY src/Counter.sol:Counter
      ```

      **4. View your contract**

      Paste the address from the output into the [Taiko block explorer](https://explorer.jolnir.taiko.xyz) and verify that the contract was deployed.

      **1. Create a project with Hardhat**

      ```sh
      npx hardhat
      ```

      **2. Add Taiko to your Hardhat config**
      <Callout type="warning">
      For the `accounts` array, you will need to enter the private key of the account you are deploying the contract with. It is **not recommended** to hardcode the private key like this (an environment variable would be better, but is still risky).

      Use a throwaway wallet to be safe. Don't reveal the private key of a wallet with significant value!
      </Callout>

      ```ts {6-13} filename=hardhat.config.ts
      import { HardhatUserConfig } from "hardhat/config";
      import "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox";

      const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
         solidity: "0.8.18",
         networks: {
            taiko: {
               url: "https://rpc.jolnir.taiko.xyz",
               accounts: [
                  "0xf214f2b2cd398c806f84e317254e0f0b801d0643303237d97a22a48e01628897",
               ],
            },
         },
      };

      export default config;
      ```

      **3. Deploy your contract on Taiko**

      ```sh
      npx hardhat run --network taiko scripts/deploy.ts
      ```

      **4. View your contract**
      Paste the address from the output into the Taiko block explorer and verify that the contract was deployed.

      **1. Deploy your smart contract using Thirdweb**

      Create a basic Hardhat project. To initialize a Hardhat project, follow these steps :

      Step 1: Initialize the Node.js project 
      
      Use npm or yarn to initialize a Node.js project. We recommend npm 7 or later. Run the following commands in the terminal :
      
      ```bash
      npm init -y
      ```

      Step 2: Installing Hardhat 
      
      Install Hardhat as a development dependency in your project with the following command :

      ```bash
      npm install --save-dev hardhat
      ```

      Step 3: Initializing the Hardhat project 
      
      Run the following command to create a Hardhat project with minimal configuration :
      
      ```bash
      npx hardhat init
      ```

      You'll be presented with a menu allowing you to choose various options. 
      
      Choose "Create a JavaScript project". 
      
      Hardhat will automatically create a default project configuration in a hardhat.config.js file.

      ![select a smart contract](/images/guides/deploy-thirdweb/thirdweb1.png)


      Don't forget to name your project : for example "thirdwebtaiko"

      ![select a smart contract](/images/guides/deploy-thirdweb/thirdweb2.png)

      Project structure :

      After initialization, your project will have the following default structure :

      ![select a smart contract](/images/guides/deploy-thirdweb/thirdweb3.png)

      If you need more help about using Hardhat, you can find the documentation here : https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/project-setup

      **We will now continue building out Hardhat project by developing a contract.**

      Step 1: Install the thirdweb CLI by executing the command

      ```bash
      npm i thirdweb
      ```

      Step 2: Create a new file "MyTestContract.sol" in the "Contracts" folder, as shown in the screenshot above.

      If you want to use the CLI :

      ```bash
      nano contracts/MyTestContract.sol
      ```

      Step 3: Open "MyTestContract" an write your contract inside

      For example:

      ```bash
      // SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
      pragma solidity ^0.8.9;
 
      contract Storage {
        address payable public owner;
        uint256 public num;
 
        event Stored(uint amount);
 
        constructor() payable {
          owner = payable(msg.sender);
        }
 
      function StoreNum(uint256 _num) public{
        num=_num;
        emit Stored(num);
        }
  
      }
      ```

      Step 4:
      Navigate to the root directory of your project and execute the following command:

      ```bash
      npx thirdweb deploy
      ```

      Executing this command will trigger the following actions:

      - Compiling all the contracts in the current directory.
      - Providing the option to select which contract(s) you wish to deploy.
      - Uploading your contract source code (ABI) to IPFS.
      - Directly navigate you to a dashboard interface which will open in your default browser.

      **2. Dashboard interface**

      ![select a smart contract](/images/guides/deploy-thirdweb/thirdweb4.png)

      Fill in the "Unlock Time" (or "_unlockTime") attribute, which represents a period of time in seconds. 1 minute would be represented by 60 seconds, 1 hour would be represented by 3600 seconds, 1 day would be represented by 86400 seconds.

      ![select a smart contract](/images/guides/deploy-thirdweb/thirdweb-deploy.png)

      Click on the connect wallet button on the dashboard and connect your metamask wallet that has testnet ETH on Taiko jolnir L2.

      Select the network as Taiko Jolnir L2

      Click on "Deploy Now" button.

      This will intiate a transaction to deploy the contract on Taiko Jolnir L2

      ![select a smart contract](/images/guides/deploy-thirdweb/thirdweb-transaction.png)

      After completing the transaction it will request you to sign a message to create a dashboard interface for you smart contract.

      ![select a smart contract](/images/guides/deploy-thirdweb/thirdweb-message.png)

      Now your contract is deployed on the Taiko Jolnir L2.

      ![select a smart contract](/images/guides/deploy-thirdweb/thirdweb-dashboard.png)

      When it is completed, it will open a dashboard interface to finish filling out the parameters.

      - `_name`: contract name
      - `_symbol`: symbol or "ticker"
      - `_royaltyRecipient`: wallet address to receive royalties from secondary sales
      - `_royaltyBps`: basis points (bps) that will be given to the royalty recipient for each secondary sale, e.g. 500 = 5%

      **3. Select `Taiko (Alpha-3 Testnet)` as the network**

      **4. Manage additional settings on your contract’s dashboard**

      You can manage settings as needed such as for uploading NFTs, configuring permissions, and more.

      For additional information on Deploy, please reference [thirdweb’s documentation](https://portal.thirdweb.com/deploy?utm_source=taiko&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=chain_docs).
